# Spell Battle Game
### Point of the game:
The game concept will be a spell casting game that involves exploring a world, discovering new spells, and fighting bosses. It will be a text-based game, and we will use ASCII character art to make characters and enemies. We will also include different elemental spells and implement a method for different keys to control each.
