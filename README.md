We're deciding between a spell based text based adventure game and a MadLibs generator smiley face 

## [Spell Based Adventure Game](https://github.com/MisterNo0ne/PythonGroupTwoA2Prog/tree/main/SpellBattleGame)

Description: Text-based adventure games are electronic games that use a text-based user interface. This game concept allows the player to fully direct and make in-game decisions through input. Our game idea will be a spell casting game that involves exploring a world, discovering new spells, and fighting bosses.

## [MadLibs Generator](https://github.com/MisterNo0ne/PythonGroupTwoA2Prog/tree/main/Madlibs)

Description: MadLibs are story generators that uses a "fill in the blank feature" to allow the player to create the story. The player generally will input nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and other parts of speech to fill in a phrasal template to create a fun silly story.
