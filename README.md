We're deciding between a spell based text based adventure game and a MadLibs generator smiley face 

[Spell Based Adventure Game](https://github.com/MisterNo0ne/PythonGroupTwoA2Prog/tree/main/SpellBattleGame)
Description: Text-based adventure games are electronic games that uses a text-based user interface. The game concept will be a spell casting game that involves exploring a world, discovering new spells, and fighting bosses. It will be a text-based game, and we will use ASCII character art to make characters and enemies. We will also include different elemental spells and implement a method for different keys to control each.



[MadLibs Generator](https://github.com/MisterNo0ne/PythonGroupTwoA2Prog/tree/main/Madlibs)
Description: MadLibs are story generators that uses a "fill in the blank feature" to allow the player to create the story. The player generally will input nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and other parts of speech to fill in a phrasal template to create a fun silly story.
