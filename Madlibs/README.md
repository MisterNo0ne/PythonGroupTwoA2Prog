### Description
Madlibs are interactive stories in which the player inputs nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and more to fill in a phrasal template made by the developers. The idea of a Madlibs is for the player to pick random words given a part of speech. For example if the game asks for a noun, the player could return "cow." After picking a bunch of words, the game will return a full story where some words were replaced with the player's entries to create a funny story. Our idea will be very thematical for example som madlib examples would be space alien abduction, bus rides, superheroes, and different genres of stories.
